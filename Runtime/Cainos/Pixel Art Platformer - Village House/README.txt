--------------------------------------------------

Thank you for purchasing this package. 
For any problems please contact support@cainos.net

--------------------------------------------------

The scene make use of two materials with special shaders to draw shadows on house sprites.

One is "MT Village House – Component". 
Common house sprites use this material. 
It makes sure shadow sprites only get drawn within visible areas of house sprites.

The other one is "MT Village House – Shadow". 
Shadow sprites use this material. 
It works together with the material mentioned above to mask shadows inside house sprites and make sure shadows only get drawn once. 
You can change the shadow color globally with the "Tint" parameter of the material.

These two materials internally use stencil. Make sure their "Stencil Ref Value" be the same value.

In "Assets/Cainos/Pixel Art Platformer - Village House/Texture/House Preset" you can find house presets in single image.
In case you do not want to use the prefab ones.
